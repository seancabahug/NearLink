Play with friends on a single computer using only your phones; no extra controllers needed! Our submission for the 2019 Congressional App Challenge.

As of 11/1/2019, iOS has seen several issues in regards to this application; it is highly recommended to use Chrome on Android.

## Set-up
1. Download this git repository and extract.
2. Run "NearLink.exe", the setup process will begin.
3. Proceed with the vJoy installation. If vJoy is not installed, the application will not work.
4. Rerun "NearLink.exe". The application has finished setup.

## How to use
1. Start "NearLink.exe", and wait for the server to completely initialize.
2. After server initialization, instruct all players (max 4) to connect to the URL listed on your screen through their phone's web browsers (it should look similar to `012.345.678.910:14178`).
3. Ensure that all players have set their unique player number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
4. Start a game that has controller support.
